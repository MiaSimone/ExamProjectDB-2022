### To Run the Program:
1. You will have to create a database in MongoDB named Exam Project and a collection called Bookings.

3. Third you have to start your redis server.
4. At last you need to create a Neo4j database called analysis.
5. Now you can run the Redis.ipynb LAST line and use the program. (You do not have to run the entire file because the important part is saved in application.py)
